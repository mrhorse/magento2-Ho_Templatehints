![Overview $0](docs/total-workings.gif)

Ho_Templatehints extends the default Magento template hints.

- Easily accessible with with muscle memory `?ath=1`.
- Shows hints for **Templates**, **AbstractBlocks** (Blocks), **Containers** and **UI Components**.
- No layout interference: Using css outline instead of borders of other HTML elements, so it doesn't f'up the layout.

#### Tweak Magento configuration as you wish

If you're running Magento with Vagrant or Docker, you're likely to wish to map the paths
between your web server and your actual host where the files sit so you can open the right
file with PHPStorm directly from the console.

## Usage
1. Set your Magento 2 installation to developer mode (when in production mode make sure to add your IP-address in Developer Client Restrictions).
2. Add `?ath=1` to your URL to activate.
3. Open up your console in you Chrome/Firefox/Safari/~IE~ devtools.
4. hold <kbd>⇧</kbd> (shift)
5. Hover over the element you wish to inspect
6. Voila! Hints everywhere!

### Hints for hidden elements
You can't show hints for a hidden element, for that purpose there is `hint($0)`:

```JS
//Select an element in the Elements panel in your devtools, it is now available with $0
hint($0)
```
